        <h1>Privacy Policy for Genesis AI</h1>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Genesis AI ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with our mobile application (the "Service").</p>
        <p>Your privacy is our priority. Since our app does not require user accounts and processes your chats locally, we handle minimal external data.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect and Why</h2>
        <p>We collect very limited information, focusing on providing core functionality while protecting your privacy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Agent Creation Prompts:</strong> To create a new AI agent, the initial descriptive prompt you provide (e.g., "a helpful assistant who is an expert in history") is sent to a third-party service (Google's Gemini API) to generate the agent's configuration.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Chat and Image Data (Processed Locally):</strong> Your ongoing chat conversations, including any text or images you send to your created agents, are processed <b>locally on your device</b> by a mobile LLM. <b>This data is NOT sent to our servers or any third-party servers.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Location Information:</strong> If you use the weather tool, we will request access to your device's location to provide accurate weather forecasts. Your location is sent to a third-party weather service for this purpose only and is not stored by us.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Locally Stored Data (On Your Device):</strong> Your entire chat history with all AI agents is stored <b>exclusively on your device</b> using a local database. We do not have access to this information. This data remains on your device unless you clear the app's data or uninstall the app.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal data. To provide the app's functionality, we share very specific data with third-party service providers. <b>Your personal chat conversations are never shared.</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Google (Gemini API):</strong> We share <b>only the agent creation prompt</b> with Google to set up your AI agent's personality. Your subsequent chats with that agent are not sent to Google. We encourage you to review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Weather API Provider:</strong> Your location data is shared with a third-party weather service solely to fetch weather information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Hugging Face:</strong> To download local AI models to your device, the app communicates with Hugging Face services. You can view their policy here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/privacy" target="_blank">Hugging Face Privacy Policy</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting your data. By processing all chat conversations on your device, we ensure your personal conversations remain private. All external communications (for agent creation, weather, and model downloads) are transmitted securely over encrypted channels (HTTPS).</p>

        <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>
